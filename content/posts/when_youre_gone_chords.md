[Intro]
C             Am               Em                   G
   Hold on to love that is what I do, now that I've found you
C            Am                Em                     G
   And from above everything's stinking, they're not around you
       C                       Am 
   And in the night I could be helpless
              Em                   G
   I could be lonely, sleeping without you
       C                       Am
   And in the day everything's complex
                  Em                    G
   There's nothing simple when I'm not around you

[Chorus]
      C                     Am
But I miss you when you're gone
            Em   F
That is what I do, babe, babe, babe
         C              Am
And it's going to carry on
            Em    F
That is what I knew, babe, babe, babe

[Bridge] 
C|Am|Em|G

[Verse]
C             Am                  Em                   G
   Hold on to my hands I feel I'm sinking, sinking without you
C            Am                Em                     G
   And to my mind everything's stinking, stinking without you
       C                       Am 
   And in the night I could be helpless
              Em                   G
   I could be lonely, sleeping without you
       C                       Am
   And in the day everything's complex
                  Em                    G
   There's nothing simple when I'm not around you

[Chorus]
      C                     Am
And I miss you when you're gone
            Em   F
That is what I do, babe, babe, babe
         C              Am
And it's going to carry on
            Em    F
That is what I knew, babe, babe, babe

[Bridge] x2

[Outro]
